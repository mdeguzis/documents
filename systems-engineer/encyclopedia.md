# About

Defintions for various topics

# Data

## DDL
Data Definition Language (DDL) statements are used to define the database structure or schema. Some examples:

  * CREATE - to create objects in the database
  * ALTER - alters the structure of the database
  * DROP - delete objects from the database
  * TRUNCATE - remove all records from a table, including all spaces allocated for the records are removed
  * COMMENT - add comments to the data dictionary
  * RENAME - rename an object

## DML

Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements are used for managing data within schema objects. Some examples:

  * SELECT - retrieve data from the a database
  * INSERT - insert data into a table
  * UPDATE - updates existing data within a table
  * DELETE - deletes all records from a table, the space for the records remain
  * MERGE - UPSERT operation (insert or update)
  * CALL - call a PL/SQL or Java subprogram
  * EXPLAIN PLAN - explain access path to data
  * LOCK TABLE - control concurrency

## DCL

Data Control Language (DCL) statements. Some examples:

  * GRANT - gives user's access privileges to database
  * REVOKE - withdraw access privileges given with the GRANT command

## RDD

Spark’s primary core abstraction is called a **Resilient Distributed Dataset** or RDD. It is a distributed collection of elements that is parallelized across the cluster. In other words, a RDD is an immutable collection of objects that is partitioned and distributed across multiple physical nodes of a YARN cluster and that can be operated in parallel.

## TCL

Transaction Control (TCL) statements are used to manage the changes made by DML statements. It allows statements to be grouped together into logical transactions.

  * COMMIT - save work done
  * SAVEPOINT - identify a point in a transaction to which you can later roll back
  * ROLLBACK - restore database to original since the last COMMIT
  * SET TRANSACTION - Change transaction options like isolation level and what rollback segment to use
